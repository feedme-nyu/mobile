# Feedme Mobile Client

The mobile client for feedme is written using Google's Flutter Framework and the Dart Language. To run this client locally, you need to have the following software installations:

* Android Studio / Xcode (depending on whether you want to run on Android or iOS)
    - **For Android:** you need build tools v28.03 and Android SDK 28
    - **For Xcode:** make sure you install developer tools (`xcode-select --install`) and agree to the terms of use by openning Xcode once
* The Flutter Framework:
    - [Use this link for a guide to installing flutter on your machine and OS.](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* For development you can use an IDE like XCode or Android Studio, a "smart" text editor like VSCode with the Flutter extension installed, or just a plain old text editor and command line
* Run `flutter doctor` to make sure your install is all good.

Connect a device or emulator and then, from the root of the project, run `flutter run` to deploy.
